    "Epidemiology is very important to understand the impact and the spreading of a new virus or bactery accrocss a country. Being able to predict the spread of a given virus can impact political, medical, economical and sociological decisions. Indeed, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in this report, we will explore the CFF railway and buses network to find the spreading of a virus and the most influential spreaders. We will analyze this phenomenon with a modified SIR model. Indeed, based on the basic SIR infection model, we will attribute a probability of infection proportional to the population of the city and the type of stops (bus or train stop) and determine the most influential spreader among all the cities in Switzerland. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to answer the following questions:\n",
    "- What is the percentage of Switzerland's population attained when a virus is spread from a Swiss city?\n",
    "- What are the most critical starting cities for infection? \n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of these questions was done in different parts. First of all, it was necessary to acquire all the data on the network and prepare it for further analysis. Then the analysis was done in two main part, the first one was the computation of the main basic and centrality measures in order to understand the network's behavior and secondly we built a modifed SIR model to evaluation the spread of an infection in the network. \n",

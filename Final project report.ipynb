    "Epidemiology is very important to understand the impact and the spreading of a new virus or bactery accrocss a country. Being able to predict the spread of a given virus can impact political, medical, economical and sociological decisions. Indeed, many policy can be taken in order to reduce or react to an epidemic if governments know the critical cities in the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in this report, we will explore the CFF railway and buses network to find the spreading of a virus and the most influential spreaders. We will analyze this phenomenon with a modified SIR model. Indeed, based on the basic SIR infection model, we will attribute a probability of infection proportional to the population of the city and the type of stops (bus or train stop) and determine the most influential spreader among all the cities in Switzerland. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to answer the following questions:\n",
    "- What is the percentage of Switzerland's population attained when a virus is spread from a Swiss city?\n",
    "- What are the most critical starting cities for infection? \n",
    "\n",
    "The work on these questions was done in different parts. First of all, it was necessary to acquire all the data on the network and prepare it for further analysis. Then the analysis was done in two main part, the first one was the computation of the main basic and centrality measures in order to understand the network's behavior and secondly we built a modifed SIR model to evaluation the spread of an infection in the network. \n",

    "Understanding the behavior of a virus for a country is one of the key topic for public health policy and epidemic prevention. Moreover, public transports like train and buses are one of the common way to spread an infection accross a country. Therefore, in this report, we will analyze the CFF Railway and Buses Network in Switzerland to look at an infection spreading. We will thus try to answer the following questions:\n",
    "- What is the percentage of Switzerland's population attained when a virus is spread from a Swiss city?\n",
    "- What are the most critical starting cities for infection? \n",

    "- __Network generation with attributes__\n",

    "The last part of the data preparation was the generation of the network with all the attributes. To do this, we first create all the nodes with attributes 'Longitude', 'Latitude', 'Population', 'NodeType' from the identified relevant stops. For the NodeType attribute, only two options are considered: Train or Bus. For the Population attribute, we assign for all stops the value -1 if the stop is not link to a known city, 0 if it is a Bus stop and the actual number of the population for the train stop of the city. Then the edges are generated via the previous identified sequence of stops for each trip. \n",
